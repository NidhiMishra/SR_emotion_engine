# Emotion Engine
The Emotion Engine is an application that stores personnality of an agent
and contains its current mood. This mood is updated based on emotions generated
from action happening in the world and from the personnality of the agent. 
An emotion, representing the current state of mind of the agent, will be 
generated by the engine and be displayed on the corresponding agent.
